# odin-recipes
In this short project I'm putting to use all of the HTML knowledge I know so far, that I learned from TOP. The poject is called "RECIPES" which will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes, as stated before I will be using everything I learned about HTML this will not be using any css, so it won't look pretty yet.
